# Case B: Music Studio Infrastructure

## Client
Mr. O'Neal (Music Teacher)

## Problem
Lesson materials are scattered. Scheduling requires manual back-and-forth. No centralized system to track individual student progress.

## Goal
Build a **Music Student Profile** experience (roster, inline profiles, schedules from Sheets) with room to grow into scheduling and lesson workflows.

## Planned Features
- Music Student Profile database (instruments, genres, current songs, theory level) backed by Google Forms / Sheets
- Automated scheduling reminders/bookings (future)
- AI auto-tagging for sheet music and materials (e.g., "Intermediate / Jazz / Saxophone") (future)
- AI voice transcription for post-lesson summaries that auto-update student profiles (future)

## Setup

From this folder (`projects/case-b-music-studio/`):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (usually `http://localhost:5173`). To build a production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # optional local preview of the build
```

**Data:** The app loads **students and schedules from your Google Apps Script** (see API client comments). Mock data is not used for the live roster.

## App structure (prototype)

- **Dashboard** — roster count, student name search (links to Students with profile open), recent updates and upcoming lessons when APIs succeed.
- **Students** — directory with filters; clicking a student opens an **inline profile panel** (no separate profile URL).

## Status
🟢 Frontend MVP — dashboard, inline student profiles, Pomfret-styled shell
